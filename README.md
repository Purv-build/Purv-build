## Hi there 👋

<About Me
I’m Purv, a student who believes that learning becomes meaningful when ideas are turned into real, working systems.
I focus on making technical and mechanical projects that address practical problems and promote awareness. My interest lies in understanding how systems work and how simple mechanisms and technical thinking can be used to create effective solutions.
Projects like TapBot reflect my approach of combining technical design, mechanical concepts, and awareness-driven innovation. I enjoy working on ideas that are low-cost, practical, and easy to understand, especially those related to sustainability and daily-life challenges.
I am currently at an early stage of my journey, learning step by step, improving through experience, and building a strong foundation in technical systems and mechanical innovation.
Progress matters more than perfection.--
